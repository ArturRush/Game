# Game

Now this repo is just a banch of files which represents typical game objects.
I started with Guns as a most popular object and try to create a proper architecture to work further based on this code.
May be later this code become a library for a game creations.
Plan is to create code which is not dependent on View, so I can use it as a text adventure game, or in Unity3d.

## Update 1

For now Guns are good enough
IShooter, Ishootable, INamable interfaces are done.
GunBullet, GunClip, GunWithClip are done.

Later will provide events.
