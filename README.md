# Game

Now this repo is just a banch of files which represents typical game objects.
I started with Guns as a most popular object and try to create a proper architecture to work further based on this code.
May be later this code become a library for a game creations.
Plan is to create code which is not dependent on View, so I can use it as a text adventure game, or in Unity3d.
